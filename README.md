# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This is a comprehensive textbook project covering Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, implemented as an interactive learning platform with Docusaurus frontend and FastAPI backend.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` - Docusaurus-based textbook interface
- `backend/` - FastAPI backend with RAG capabilities
- `specs/` - Specification-driven development artifacts
- `.specify/` - SDD framework files

## Features

- Interactive textbook content covering ROS 2, Simulation Environments, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems
- AI-powered exercise validation and feedback
- Simulation integration for hands-on learning
- Personalized learning paths based on user background

## Setup

1. Install Node.js and Python 3.9+
2. Set up the frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm start`
3. Set up the backend: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py`
