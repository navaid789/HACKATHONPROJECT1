# Instructor Resources

Welcome to the instructor resources section for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This section provides educational materials, curriculum guidance, and teaching resources to help educators effectively implement this content in their courses.

## Course Overview

This textbook provides comprehensive coverage of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics across four integrated modules:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Middleware for robot control, nodes, topics, services, and URDF
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics simulation, environment building, and sensor simulation
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Advanced perception, training, and navigation systems
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - The convergence of LLMs and robotics for natural interaction

## Learning Objectives by Module

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Implement nodes, topics, and services for robot control
- Create URDF models for humanoid robots

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Design and simulate robot environments using Gazebo
- Integrate Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction
- Implement sensor simulation and fusion techniques

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- Leverage Isaac Sim for physics simulation and AI training
- Implement GPU-accelerated perception using Isaac ROS
- Configure autonomous navigation systems with Nav2

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Develop Vision-Language-Action systems for embodied AI
