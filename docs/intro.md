# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

This comprehensive textbook provides an in-depth exploration of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, covering the essential concepts, tools, and technologies needed to develop intelligent, embodied systems. From fundamental ROS 2 concepts to advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, this textbook guides you through the complete stack of technologies required for modern robotics development.

## Course Structure

The textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules, each building upon the previous to create a complete understanding of Physical AI systems:

### Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals and Architecture
- **Chapter 1**: ROS 2 Fundamentals and Architecture
- **Chapter 2**: Nodes, Topics, and Services
- **Chapter 3**: URDF for Humanoid Robots

### Module 2: Digital Twin and Simulation
- **Chapter 4**: Gazebo Simulation Fundamentals
- **Chapter 5**: Unity Integration and High-Fidelity Rendering
- **Chapter 6**: Sensor Simulation and Integration

### Module 3: AI-Robot Brain Integration
- **Chapter 7**: Isaac Sim for Physical AI
- **Chapter 8**: Isaac ROS for GPU-Accelerated Perception
- **Chapter 9**: Navigation (Nav2) for Humanoid Robots

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Systems
- **Chapter 10**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems
